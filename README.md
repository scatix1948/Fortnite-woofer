# Fortnite-woofer

With this program you can actually unban yourself in Fortnite (ONLY BATTLE ROYALE, NOT CASH CUPS)

You just have to start woofer.bat and the rest will take care of itself.
After the woof you have to look at the bottom right to see if it says that your Windows license is no longer valid. If it says so, it worked

# I TAKE NO LIABILITY IF THIS DOES NOT WORK AND THE PC SUFFERS ANY DAMAGE SO CREATE A BACKUP BEFORE!
